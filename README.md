# One Roost / Next Steps
## Development Set up
to watch for changes in `.jsx` files, do this from the project root:

```
cd public
babel watch jsx/ --out-dir out/js
```

to enter Parse develop mode where code is automatically updated, run this, assuming you have the dev alias set up:
```
parse develop dev
```

You can then test your changes at [dev.oneroost.com](http://dev.oneroost.com)
